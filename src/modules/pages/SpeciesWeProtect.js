                    Every second breath we take is courtesy of the ocean, and marine species play a vital role in
                    supporting all life on Earth – but every day ocean wildlife face an increasingly urgent threat:
                    humans.

                    Life began in the ocean and the seas cover nearly three quarters of our planet’s surface. Yet, the
                    striking and abundant marine biodiversity of the world’s oceans are collapsing, largely driven by
                    anthropogenic – human-driven – factors. Our global campaigns work tirelessly to safeguard and
                    protect vulnerable marine species from unsustainable human activities including industrial fishing,
                    overfishing, plastic pollution and climate change.

                    All six species of sea turtles found in the United States are endangered. With up to one million
                    species
                    facing extinction in the next century, sea turtles and other marine wildlife are especially
                    threatened
                    by industrial fishing, climate change, plastic pollution, environmental rollbacks, and habitat loss.
                    Turtle Island Restoration Network addresses these threats using a conservation toolkit spanning
                    hands-on
                    conversation, community-based habitat restoration, advocacy for sound environmental policies and
                    regulatory action, grassroots organizing, promotion of marine wildlife “swimways” and protected
                    areas,
                    outreach and volunteerism, and innovative climate change adaptation efforts.

                    We have witnessed unprecedented environmental rollbacks during the Trump administration that prevent
                    protections for marine wildlife and threaten the resiliency of all marine species. Our plan for
                    saving marine species in the coming years focuses on addressing the following significant threats:
                    reducing the capture of vulnerable marine wildlife by driftnet, longline and shrimp fisheries;
                    removing and recycling plastic pollution from beaches and oceans, and studying the impacts of
                    microplastics on marine wildlife and habitats; strengthening resilience of endangered marine
                    wildlife populations against impacts; and protect key biodiversity habitats in the Northern Pacific,
                    Gulf of Mexico, and Eastern Tropical Pacific.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-3'>
                    While many of our species-saving programs require political will and leadership from governments and
                    industry, we are far from powerless. Each and every conservation steward can take bold individual
                    and collective action to help protect and save marine species, and fight for the oceans that sustain
                    all life on Earth.
